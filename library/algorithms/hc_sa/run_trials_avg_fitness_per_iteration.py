    Notes
    When computing the average fitness per iteration across multiple trials, we may encounter
    fitness histories (lists) of different lengths. This happens when the optimization algorithm 
    (concretely Hill Climbing) converges early â€” i.e., stops before reaching the max number of iterations.

    If we don't handle this, using zip(*all_fitness_histories) will truncate to the shortest list,
    which would result in misleading averages and incomplete plots.

    Solution:
    To make all fitness histories the same length, we pad the shorter ones by repeating their final
    fitness value until they reach the length of the longest history. This ensures consistent averaging
    across all iterations.
