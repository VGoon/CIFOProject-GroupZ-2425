By choosing swaps only among people with predefined valued relationships, it assumes that moving in that narrow direction always leads to improvement, which causes it to get trapped in local optima very early. Additionally, it generates fewer, more similar neighbors which limits the algorithm’s ability to explore diverse solutions and increases premature convergence."

    "> According to `Venachi et al.`, when comparing the performance of different optimization configurations (e.g., different variants of Genetic Algorithms, Hill Climbing, or Simulated Annealing), it is important to assess whether the observed differences are **statistically significant**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> While it is possible to run statistical tests at each generation (i.e., per-iteration analysis), this is rarely done in practice due to complexity and the risk of multiple comparisons. Instead, it is typical and sufficient to evaluate significance **only at termination**, by comparing the **final fitness values** obtained across multiple independent runs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The recommended procedure is as follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Run multiple trials** (e.g., 30) for each configuration being compared.\n",
    "> 2. **Extract the final fitness value** from each trial (usually the best fitness in the last generation or iteration).\n",
    "> 3. **Check for normality** in the fitness distributions using the `Kolmogorov–Smirnov test`.\n",
    "> 4. Based on the normality result:\n",
    ">    - If both samples are normally distributed, apply a `Student’s t-test`.\n",
    ">    - If at least one sample is not normal, use a **non-parametric test**, such as the `Mann–Whitney U test` (the one we will use), **Wilcoxon rank-sum**, or **Kruskal–Wallis**.\n",
    "> 5. **Interpret the p-value**:\n",
    ">    - If **p < 0.05**, the difference is statistically significant.\n",
    ">    - Otherwise, we conclude that the difference may be due to chance.\n",
